- 👋 Hi, I’m @FYGS.
- 👀 I’m a software engineer interested in new technologies and always learning new things. I'm currently more interested in Web technologies. Especially REST API services and all about backend developpement: NodeJS, Spring Boot. Also all the fantastic JS libraries using TypeScript: Angular, NestJS, NuxtJS, VueJS, ReactJS and so on.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack skills using full JavaScript/TypeScript from the backend to the frontend.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects having full JavaScript/TypeScript stack and even more.
